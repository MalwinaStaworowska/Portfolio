There are more things in Heaven and Earth,
Than are dream of in your philosophy.
Shakespeare

There are wonders in heaven and on earth about which
not dreamed of by your philosophers.



CHOIR
Dark everywhere, deaf everywhere
What will it be, what will it be?

SORCERER
Close the chapel door
And stand around the coffin;
No lamp, no candle,
Hang shrouds in the windows.
Let the moon's brightness fade
It doesn't come through cracks here.
Just be bold, just be bold.

OLD MAN
As you said, it happened.

CHOIR
Dark everywhere, deaf everywhere
What will it be, what will it be?

SORCERER
Clean souls!
On any website in the world:
That is, which burns in tar,
So it's freezing at the bottom of the river,
That is, for a more severe punishment
Implanted in raw wood,
When the embers bite her in the oven,
And he squeaks and cries bitterly;
Everyone hurry to the group!
Let the gang gather here!
Here we celebrate Grandpa!
Descend into the holy place;
There is alms, there are prayers,
And food and drink.

CHOIR
Dark everywhere, deaf everywhere
What will it be, what will it be?
